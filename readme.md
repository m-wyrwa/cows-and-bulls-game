# Cows And Bulls Game

## Exercise 18

https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/07/05/18-cows-and-bulls.html

Create a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user.

The game works like this:

Say the number generated by the computer is 1038.
An example interaction could look like this:

> Welcome to the Cows and Bulls Game!
>
> Enter a number:
>
> 1234
>
> 2 cows, 0 bulls
>
> 1256
>
> 1 cow, 1 bull
>
> ...

Until the user guesses the number.

### TODO-1:

* Randomly generate a n-digit number. The digits must be all different.

### TODO-2:

* Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. The digits of the number guessed also must all be different.
* Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.

### TODO-3:

* For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”.
* For every digit the user guessed correctly, but in the different place, there is a “bull”.
* For every digit the user guessed incorrectly there is no "bull" nor "cow".
* Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have.

### TODO-4:

* Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over.

### TODO-5:

* Implement a variable into the game which can set numbers of digits to guess.
